# Digital Image Processing project - 64CS2
This is the Project of Digital Image Processing in class 64CS2 - Group 4. Group members are studying Computer Science of Hanoi University of Civil Engineering (HUCE)! In this project, we will research for project is Face Detection! Face Detection is a technique very important in Digital Image Processing! <br>

**Application for Face Detection in life:** <br>
1, Facial recognition system (Example: In station, In Airport) <br>
2, Facial motion capture <br>
3, Emtional Inference <br> 
4, Marktering <br>
5, Photography <br>

**This is content for project of Group 4 - 64CS2:**  <br>
1, Color Segmentation <br>
2, Image Segmentation <br>
3, Image Matching <br>
4, Result for Programming Code.
